# undart
Obsolete software for extracting data from the 1998 dart tgz files and for doing the conversions needed to manually build early saildart.org web site content. 
The undart repository is succeeded by the remake, relink and rebuild repositories and the time-capsule named **flat_DART_data8**.
The undart data should come from the tgz time-capsule, the first ten reels of 9-track DART tape are in the private repository named **DART1998-tgz**
I know that the primary use of GitHub should be for building new software, and not for keeping archival data, mirroring or backups.
Please forgive me, the purpose of this repository is archival. 
This repository also serves as documenting a step in the provenance of its successors.

When there is no makefile in a directory, the main 'C' program is self-compiling and leaves the binary in the same dot directory.
