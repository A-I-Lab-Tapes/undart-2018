# suail1970s
My work-in-progress on a heap-of-software to preserve-and-present the SAILDART archive of backup tape data from the first Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab of the 1970s. 

In sub directories the README file is named "!" bang. The 'C' programs are self-compiling - look at and change the top few lines to get the destination binary to go where you want. There are no makefiles, I just source FOO.c to execute a little bash scripting to do the gcc.
